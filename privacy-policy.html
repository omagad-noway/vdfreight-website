We apply different retention periods to different categories of Personal Data based on the purpose of processing and legal obligations:<br>

                        <ul>
                                <li><strong>Account Information</strong>

                    <br><br>

                        <li>Deletion: Personal Data is removed from Our systems and no longer actively processed.</li>
                        <li>Backup retention: Residual copies may remain in encrypted backups for a limited period consistent with our backup retention schedule and are not restored except where necessary for security, disaster recovery, or legal compliance.</li>
                        <li>Anonymization: In some cases, We convert Personal Data into anonymous statistical data that cannot be linked back to You. This anonymized data may be retained indefinitely for research and analytics.</li>

The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of Your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of Your data and other personal information.<br><br>


                    <h5 class="">Delete Your Personal Data</h5> 
                    <p class="">You have the right to delete or request that We assist in deleting the Personal Data that We have collected about You.<br><br>

                    <h5 class="">Business Transactions</h5> <br>
                    <p>If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, Your Personal Data may be transferred. We will provide notice before Your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.</p>

                    <p>Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose Your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government agency).</p>
                    <h5 class="">Other legal requirements</h5> <br>
                    <p>The Company may disclose Your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:

                    </p>

                    If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your country requires consent from a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before We collect and use that information.</p> <br><br>
